# **Secret Santa**
## **Site Overview**
Secret Santa is a platform that brings together people who want to take part in a charity event that aims to bring joy to children from vulnerable families on the eve of Christmas. 

The site will focus on two categories of users. The first is children who apply for a gift and write what they would like to receive. The second - people who want to give a Christmas present to children who have written to Santa on this site.

### **Wireframes:**

The site was originally supposed to look like this:

![Wireframes-1](https://github.com/Julia-cloudname/Project_1/blob/main/assets/images/Warframe_1.png)
![Wireframes-2](https://github.com/Julia-cloudname/Project_1/blob/main/assets/images/Warframe_2.png)
![Wireframes-3](https://github.com/Julia-cloudname/Project_1/blob/main/assets/images/Warframe_3.png)
![Wireframes-4](https://github.com/Julia-cloudname/Project_1/blob/main/assets/images/Warframe_4.png)

### **Color Scheme:**

For the page I decided on a green ( #6CA159) and white (#FAECEC) theme with gray font (#4F5656) to create a to the new year style. Green New Year tree symbolizes the Christmas and New Year holidays.

### **Typography**

* Throughout the page, there are three fonts used:
  * Domine - for all content text.
  * Playfair Display - for headings
  * Berkshire Swash - for cover text in green block
  
*  Domine  and Playfair Display were both selected to complement each other.
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.

## **Current Features Common to all pages**

#### *Navigation Bar:*

  - Featured on all pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery, Contacts and Sign Up pages and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

## **Future-Enhancements**

* At the time of making this page I didn't have the understanding to actual using form with changing fields depend on user choise. This is
would improve the users experience.

* I didn't have the understanding how to add bottom Top without JS.

**Testing Phase**
