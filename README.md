# **Secret Santa**
## **Site Overview**
Secret Santa is a platform that brings together people who want to take part in a charity event that aims to bring joy to children from vulnerable families on the eve of Christmas. 

The site will focus on two categories of users. The first is children who apply for a gift and write what they would like to receive. The second - people who want to give a Christmas present to children who have written to Santa on this site.

### **Wireframes:**

The site was originally supposed to look like this:

<details><summary>Home page</Summary>

<details><summary>Sign up for children</Summary>
<img src="https://github.com/Julia-cloudname/Project_1/blob/main/assets/images/Warframe_4.webp"></details>


### **Color Scheme:**

For the page I decided on a green ( #6CA159) and white (#FAECEC) theme with gray font (#4F5656) to create a to the new year style. Green New Year tree symbolizes the Christmas and New Year holidays.

### **Typography**

* Throughout the page, there are three fonts used:
  * Domine - for all content text.
  * Playfair Display - for headings
  * Berkshire Swash - for cover text in green block
  
*  Domine  and Playfair Display were both selected to complement each other.
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.

## **Current Features Common to all pages**

## **Future-Enhancements**

would improve the users experience.
